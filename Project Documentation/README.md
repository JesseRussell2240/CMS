The purpose of this code is to be able to record audio from a user

Further down the line the program will have a fully opperational
GUI giving users an option to chose the length, bit rate, destination
and encryption of the message. 

CMS V0.0.1
The basic use of the program so far consists of launching up and

they want to save it and if so where. Then gives them an option to replay
the saved audio
